### Introduction

The food sector has been getting a lot of advancement lately with the production of food ordering application(s) such as GrabFood, ShopeeFood, Food Panda, etc.. Therefore, as a group of graduates-to-be from International Islamic University Malaysia, we have decided to dedicate our journey into creating the “Food Delivery Website IIUM”.

### Objectives

* To create a website that compiles every Mahallah’s cafeteria providers,
* To create a website that compiles every Mahallah’s coop stores,
* To create a website that helps every IIUM students’ runners or food runners,
* To create a website that helps with every IIUM students’ hunger needs,
* To create a website that provides delivery services across campus,
* To create a website that simplifies orders and deliveries,
* To create a hassle-free user interface that customers will have no problem navigating through

### Views

The view specifies how the data in the app should be displayed. Based on the user's actions, it displays data to the user in an easy-to-understand format. In our food and beverage menu app, the view would describe how the menu is presented and receive data from the model to display.

### Controllers

The controller contains logic that updates the model and/or view in response to app users' input. For example, our food and beverage menu could include input forms and buttons for adding and removing items. Because these actions necessitate updating the model, the input is sent to the controller, which then manipulates the model as needed before sending updated data to the view. The user may also want to simply update the view to display the data in a different format, such as changing the item order to from lowest to highest price. In this case, the controller could handle it without requiring an update to the model.


### Routes

Routing in Laravel allows the user to direct all application requests to the correct controller. Routing controllers also enable users to create controller classes that contain methods for handling requests.
 Below are the customer registration and authentication routes used for them to log in to the website and make orders.

### Models

The model specifies what data should be included in the app. If the state of this data changes, the model will usually notify the view so that the display can be updated as needed and occasionally the controller in which if different logic is needed to control the updated view. It also structures the data and prepares it in accordance with the controller's instructions. Returning to our food and beverages menu app, the model would specify what data the menu items should contain which are item, price, and so on as well as which menu items are already present.
